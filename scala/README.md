# vscode-devcontainer-scala

A VSCode [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for Scala.

## Usage

## You May Not Want to Use This, Unless You Are Me

I'm new to Scala and JVM in general, and Docker isn't my dancehall either, so
while this is working for me, it's probably trash, who knows (I certainly
don't). I'm mostly putting this up here so I don't have to keep rebuilding it
from scratch.

If this _mostly_ works for you, but you need a few tweaks, please feel free to
fork and make those changes! But if you think those changes would make my life
better as well, please also feel free to submit PRs with them.

## License

Can you even license a Dockerfile? Well anyway I wouldn't want to if you
could, see [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/).
