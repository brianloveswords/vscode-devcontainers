A VSCode [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for Scala.

code .
```

## You May Not Want to Use This, Unless You Are Me

I'm new to Scala and that JVM life in general, also I don't really live and
breath containers either, so while this is working for me it's probably trash,
who knows (I certainly don't). I'm mostly putting this up here so I don't have
to keep rebuilding it from scratch.

If this _mostly_ works for you, but you need a few tweaks, please feel free to
fork and make those changes! But if you think those changes would make my life
better as well, please submit those PRs back to me so I can learn to not be
trash.

## License

Can you even license a Dockerfile? Well anyway I wouldn't want to if you
could, see [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/).
